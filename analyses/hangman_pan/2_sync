echo "The best way to synchronize videos seems to be manually, using tools like play2vids.py"
echo "the offset for this one seems best at 13. There are 3 flashes in the video for alignment"
echo "checkerboards start at 13700-14250"


#
##Arguments are as follows:
#-v1 and -v2 are the names of the videos to compare
#-o is the number of frames to OFFSET
#This is the values that needs to be adjusted to get the 2 videos in sync as much as possible
#
#-s is where to start the video, so you don't have to watch the whole thing every time
#-d is the delay between frames, to allow you to watch in slo-mo to really compare appearance of pulses
#
#-g -b -w are parameters that clean up noise for viewing the videos
#
#
#optional arguments:
#  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
#  -p PATH, --path PATH  path to video frame files default is ./
#  -v1 VIDEO1, --video1 VIDEO1
#                        file name for first video
#  -v2 VIDEO2, --video2 VIDEO2
#                        filename for second video
#  -g GAMMA, --gamma GAMMA
#                        value of gamma
#  -b BLACK, --black BLACK
#                        threshold below which is black
#  -w WHITE, --white WHITE
#                        threshold above which is white
#  -s START, --start START
#                        frame to start at default = 1
#  -o OFFSET, --offset OFFSET
#                        number of frames to offset two videos, positive or
#                        negative
#  -d DELAY, --delay DELAY
#                        delay time between frames for slo-mo
#
